----------------------------------------------------------

This repository is for a [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hubmap-organ-segmentation).
All paths are set, such that they can be used as a notebook in kaggle.
The architecture is adapted from the [vanilla UNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf).

## Installation
No installation is needed, if it is run in a Kaggle notebook.

## Usage

1. Run ``preprocessing.ipynb``
2. Run ``train_test.ipynb``
